# Software Lifecycle Models

Here are some iterative and sequential software lifecycle models:

## Iterative models

This type of model focuses on continuously improving a product until it is finished. With each iteration, the product may change in order to adjust with newer feedback.

### Agile

Agile methodology consists of cycles starting with an initial requirements analysis, followed by working on a prototype that satisfies these requirements, then evaluating the prototype in order to figure out what the next steps are. With each iteration, the customer may look at the state of the project so far and change the requirements in order to fit their needs. A popular implementation of this model is Scrum, which (among other elements) consists of *sprint reviews*: they allow a team to constantly check their progress and plan their next steps appropriately.

Advantages:
    
    - Customer oriented products
    - First version of a product is available sooner (compared to other models)

Disadvantages:
    
    - Requirement changes might clash with existing architecture
    - Constant changes could lead to more time spent on a project than expected

### Spiral 

This is an iterative version of the waterfall model, with a greater focus on risk analysis. The project consists of 4 steps that are being iterated over multiple times, until a desired product is achieved.

1. Determine Objectives
2. Identify Risks
3. Develop and Test
4. Plan Next iteration

Advantages:
    
    - Risks can be dealt with quickly and frequently
    - Extensive documentation

Disadvantages:
    
    - Can get expensive
    - Risk control requires professionals

## Sequential models

This type of model focuses on working with a starting base, then improving upon it one step at a time, with the intent of exposing the intended audience with a fully finished product.

### Waterfall

The waterfall model is the epitome of sequential SDLC models: start with the requirements analysis, upon completion of this step, evaluate if the project may move on to the next step, then repeat until testing/deployment. This model relies on well-defined requirements and technologies used by the project and allows for early error identification. On the other hand, it's lack of flexibility renders itself unsuitable for real world scenarios, where factors may be vague and undergoing constant change.

Advantages:
    
    - Simplistic and easy to understand
    - Easy to manage; each stage has a defined result and process review

Disadvantages:
    
    - Deployment occurs only at the end of the overall process
    - Not flexible

### V-Shaped 

This model is composed of 2 major phases: planning and testing, separated by the implementation step. Each step of the planning phase will lead to an equivalent step for the testing phase via test plans. This implies that every step within the testing phase of a product is linked to the planning phase.

Advantages:
    
    - Early test establishment
    - Useful for projects with clear and static requirements

Disadvantages:
    
    - Not flexible
    - Unsuitable for small projects
