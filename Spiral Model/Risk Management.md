# Risk Management - Spiral Model

The spiral model consists of four phases: objectives, risk analysis and resolution, development/testing, and planning for the next iteration. This model's approach is highly reliant upon identifying and mitigating risks with each iteration; here's how:

The initial risk analysis serves as a plan for future tasks and implementations by identifying most risks that threaten a project, classifying them as interface risks or development risks, and deciding upon which cycle should focus on some of these risks (thus also helping developers with prototyping and benchmarking implementations). 

## The Twist

Even though this model is highly reliant upon risk management, the process introduces its own risks:

 - Risk management is only as good as the ability of those that analyse risks. Useful and appropriate risk analysis requires highly specific technical knowledge about a project (acquiring this could prove very costly), whereas a lack of expertise could lead to risks which have been discovered very late in development (thus increasing costs spent on fixing these and schedule delays until they have been fixed).

 - Too much risk assessment could lead to cost increases and schedule delays: referring back to the previous point, risk analysis requires expertise that may be too expensive (especially for smaller scale projects).
