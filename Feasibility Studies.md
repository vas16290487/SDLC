# Feasibility Studies

## Definition 

Commiting to a project for any significant period of time could lead to a great amount of risk. A feasibility study aims to help make the decision of whether this commitment is worth the risk or if a business should drop the idea and move on.

An example of using feasibility studies would be alongside a business plan: before coming up with such a plan, one needs to assess how their service/product will be delivered to their intended audience, as well as figure out what budget they need and how they can use that budget effectively. In this case, feasibility studies would provide a deeper look at how the business will run; these can then be used in order to figure out if this business can succed as well as how it would do so.
